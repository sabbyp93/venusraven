      <h2>The BLUE Jay</h2>
      <h3>Cyanocitta cristata</h3>

    <p>Unlike the Canada Jay, the Blue Jay's territory is concentrated in the eastern half of the USA and the southern portions of Canada, including the Atlantic provinces. Blue Jays have been seen as far West as the West Coast (leaving out California, Nevada and Arizona for the mostpart) and as far North as Northern Alberta.</p>
    <p>These are similar looking jays:</p>

    <p>Most of these species have overlapping territories with the Blue Jay, but remain very local. Other than being from the same genetic family, these birds have one distinctive feature that makes them jays, their raspy voice. Of the species listed (including the blue jay), the Canada Jay is the least raspy, and the most recognizable is the Blue Jay with a voice that resembles an unwanted alarm clock.</p>
    <p>The lifespan of the blue jay can be as many as 25 years. The oldest recorded banded blue jay was at least 26 years and 11 months old, it lived a good portion of its life in Newfoundland.</p>
    <p>Mainly omnivores, they have a preference for acorns, and from personal experience, it is widely accepted that peanuts (shelled or not) and sunflower seeds are also at the top of the food choices when available. This does not keep them from eating bugs (which is their main source of nutrition) and small vertebrates.</p>
    <p>Blue Jays are incredibly intellegent and are capable of recognizing routine. For example, if you consistently feed them peanuts at 7:30 AM, they will eventually beat you to the punch and start squawking for peanuts before you get to the door. Because they do not "sing" (it's almost like they are yelling all the time), you can learn their language to a point where you have a very good idea of what is going on in the area. Their voices can be heard from quite a distance away also.</p>
    <p>To continue with their intelligence, the ones that live in areas with domesticated animals, such as cats, tend to become a little cheeky and brave. They seem to take pleasure in taunting a predator that is behind glass or a screen, knowing they can get away with it. You can even hear it in their voices when they are sitting right by the window opposite a cat.</p>
